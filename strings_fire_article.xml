    <string name="build_a_fire_title_content">To build a fire, it helps to understand the basic principles of a fire. Fuel (in a nongaseous state) does not burn directly. When you apply heat to a fuel, it produces a gas. This gas, combined with oxygen in the air, burns.</string>

Dig a hole in the ground.
On the upwind side of this hole, poke or dig a large connecting hole for ventilation.
Build your fire in the hole as illustrated.
    utely dry to be sure just a spark will ignite it. If you have a device that generates only sparks, charred cloth will be almost essential. It holds a spark for long periods, allowing you to put tinder on the hot area to generate a small flame.</string>
    <string name="HOW_TO_title">HOW TO BUILD A FIRE</string>
    <string name="HOW_TO_title_1">TEPEE</string>

    <string name="HOW_TO_1">To make a tepee fire, arrange the tinder and a few sticks of kindling in the shape of a tepee or cone. Light the center. As the tepee burns, the outside logs will fall inward, feeding the fire. This type of fire burns well even with wet wood.</string>

    <string name="HOW_TO_2">LEAN-TO</string>

    <string name="HOW_TO_content_2">To lay a lean-to fire, push a green stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle. Point the end of the stick in the direction of the wind. Place some tinder deep under this lean-to stick. Lean pieces of kindling against the lean-to stick. Light the tinder. As the kindling catches fire from the tinder, add more kindling.</string>

    <string name="HOW_to3">CROSS-DITCH</string>

    <string name="HOW_TO_3">To use the cross-ditch method, scratch a cross about 30 centimeters (12 inches) in size in the ground. Dig the cross 7.5 centimeters (about 3 inches) deep. Put a large wad of tinder in the middle of the cross. Build a kindling pyramid above the tinder. The shallow ditch allows air to sweep under the tinder to provide a draft.</string>

    <string name="HOW_4">PYRAMID</string>

    <string name="HOW_content_4">To lay the pyramid fire, place two small logs or branches parallel on the ground. Place a solid layer of small logs across the parallel logs. Add three or four more layers of logs, each layer smaller than and at a right angle to the layer below it. Make a starter fire on top of the pyramid. As the starter fire burns, it will ignite the logs below it. This gives you a fire that burns downward, requiring no attention during the night.</string>
    <string name="HOW_TO_title5">HOW TO LIGHT A FIRE</string>

    <string name="HOWs_TOs5_1">Modern igniters use modern devices. These are items that we normally think of to start a fire.</string>
    <string name="HOW_TO5">Matches</string>
    <string name="HOW_5">Make sure these matches are waterproof. Also, store them in a waterproof container along with a dependable striker pad.</string>
    <string name="HOW6">Convex Lens</string>
    <string name="HOW6_content_3">Use this method only on bright, sunny days. The lens can come from binoculars, a camera, telescopic sights, or magnifying glasses. Angle the lens to concentrate the sun rays on the tinder. Hold the lens over the same spot until the tinder begins to smolder. Gently blow or fan the tinder into a flame and apply it to the fire lay.</string>
    <string name="HOW74">Metal Match</string>
    <string name="HOW7_4">Place a flat, dry leaf under your tinder with a portion exposed. Place the tip of the metal match on the dry leaf, holding the metal match in one hand and a knife in the other. Scrape your knife against the metal match to produce sparks. The sparks will hit the tinder. When the tinder starts to smolder, proceed as above.</string>
    <string name="HOW8_8">Battery</string>
    <string name="HOW888">Use a battery to generate a spark. Use of this method depends on the type of battery available. Attach a wire to each terminal. Touch the ends of the bare wires together next to the tinder so the sparks will ignite it. Steel wool will ignite if it touches both wires or terminals. If you need to charge the battery first - have a look into the Power Section - there you also see an option on how to generate power with the heat of a fire.</string>
    <string name="HOW96">Gunpowder</string>
    <string name="HOW_9content_6">Often, you will have ammunition with your equipment. If so, carefully extract the bullet from the shell casing by moving the bullet back and forth. Use the gunpowder as tinder. Discard the casing and primers. A spark will ignite the powder.</string>
    <string name="PRIMITIVE_METHODS_title">PRIMITIVE METHODS</string>
    <string name="PRIMITIVE_METHODS_title_1">Flint and Steel</string>
    <string name="PRIMITIVE_METHODS_content_1">The direct spark method is the easiest of the primitive methods to use. The flint and steel method is the most reliable of the direct spark methods. Strike a flint or other hard, sharp-edged rock with a piece of carbon steel (stainless steel will not produce a good spark). This method requires a loose-jointed wrist and practice. When the tinder catches a spark, blow on it. The spark will spread and burst into flames.</string>
    <string name="PRIMITIVE_METHODS_title_2">Fire-Plow</string>
    <string name="PRIMITIVE_METHODS_content_2">The fire-plow is a friction method of ignition. To use this method, cut a straight groove in a softwood base and plow the blunt tip of a hardwood shaft up and down the groove. The plowing action of the shaft pushes out small particles of wood fibers. Then, as you apply more pressure on each stroke, the friction ignites the wood particles.</string>
    <string name="PRIMITIVE_METHODS_title_3">Bow and Drill</string>
    <string name="PRIMITIVE_METHODS_content">To use the bow and drill, first prepare the fire lay. Then place a bundle of tinder under the V-shaped cut in the fire board. Place one foot on the fire board. Loop the bowstring over the drill and place the drill in the precut depression on the fire board. Place the socket, held in one hand, on the top of the drill to hold it in position. Press down on the drill and saw the bow back and forth to twirl the drill. Once you have established a smooth motion, apply more downward pressure and work the bow faster. This action will grind hot black powder into the tinder, causing a spark to catch. Blow on the tinder until it ignites.</string>
