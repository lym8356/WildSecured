The pupil is horizontal, and the iris is gold with distinct black spotting. Fingers are unwebbed and toes are fully webbed. Young toads often have a grey back, with distinct yellow or red spots or patches. Adults have large parotid glands on the shoulders, which secrete toxins when the toad is under threat. ","They are found in open forests, grasslands, swamps, beach dunes, farmland and suburban areas.","The skin of the adult cane toad is toxic, as well as the enlarged parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across its back. When the toad is threatened, its glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human deaths have been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads.",4,Others,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Canetoadmale.jpg
Australian magpie,Gymnorhina tibicen,"Black and white body, thick white bill.","Body black and white. Male: top of head, wings, face, underparts and tail tip black; wing-bar and rest of upperparts white. Female: like male, but duller and back mottled grey. Body up to 45 cm long.",Most areas.,"Australian Magpies are strongly territorial and defend their territories both from other magpies as well as potential predators. Unfortunately, some individual magpies perceive humans as a potential threat and accordingly, swoop down with a fast warning flight, occasionally making contact. Only a small minority of Australian Magpies behaves like this, and some of these aggressive magpies will only swoop on particular people.",2,Others,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Cracticus_tibicen_hypoleuca_male_domain.jpg
