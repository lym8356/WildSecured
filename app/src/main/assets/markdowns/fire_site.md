## Site Selection and Preparation

Rainwater collected in clean containers or in plants is usually safe for drinking. However, purify water from lakes, ponds, swamps, springs, or streams, especially the water near human settlements or in the tropics.

When possible, purify all water you get from vegetation or from the ground by boiling or using iodine or chlorine. After purifying a canteen of water, you must partially unscrew the cap and turn the canteen upside down to rinse unpurified water from the threads of the canteen where your mouth touches.

You will have to decide what site and arrangement to use. Before building a fire consider:

* The area (terrain and climate) in which you are operating.
* The materials and tools available.
* Time; how much time do you have?
* Need; why do you need a fire?
* Security; do we have to hide it to prevent attracting problems?

Look for a dry spot that:

* Is protected from the wind.
* Is suitably placed in relation to your shelter (if any).
* Will concentrate the heat in the direction you desire.
* Has a supply of wood or other fuel available.

If you are in a wooded or brush-covered area, clear the brush and scrape the surface soil from the spot you have selected. Clear a circle at least 1 meter (3 feet) in diameter so there is little chance of the fire spreading.

If time allows, construct a fire wall using logs or rocks. This wall will help to reflect or direct the heat where you want it. It will also reduce flying sparks and cut down on the amount of wind blowing into the fire. However, you will need enough wind to keep the fire burning.

> **CAUTION**
> 
> Do not use wet or porous rocks as they may explode when heated.

In some situations, you may find that an underground fireplace will best meet your needs.
It conceals the fire and serves well for cooking food.
To make an underground fireplace or Dakota fire hole:

* Dig a hole in the ground.
* On the upwind side of this hole, poke or dig a large connecting hole for ventilation.
* Build your fire in the hole as illustrated.

If you are in a snow-covered area, use green logs to make a dry base for your fire. Trees with wrist-sized trunks are easily broken in extreme cold. Cut or break several green logs and lay them side by side on top of the snow. Add one or two more layers. Lay the top layer of logs opposite those below it.
