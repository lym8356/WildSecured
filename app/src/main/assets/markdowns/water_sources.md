## Water Sources

![](file:///android_asset/images/water_sources.png)

Almost any environment has water present to some degree. Possible sources of water are listed below.  
If you do not have a canteen, cup, can, or other type of container, improvise one from plastic or water-resistant cloth. Shape the plastic or cloth into a bowl by pleating it. Use pins or other suitable items even your hands to hold the pleats.

      <summary>Frigid areas: Snow and ice</summary>
      Do not eat without melting! Eating snow or ice can reduce body temperature and lead to more dehydration. Snow or ice are no purer than the water from which they come. Sea ice that is gray in color or opaque is salty. Do not use it without desalting it. Sea ice that is crystalline with a bluish cast has little salt in it.

      <ul>
          <li>Ground Dig hole deep enough to allow water to seep in; obtain rocks, build fire, and heat rocks; drop hot rocks in water; hold cloth over hole to absorb steam; wring water from cloth. Alternate method if a container or bark pot is available: Fill container or pot with seawater; build fire and boil water to produce steam; hold a cloth over the container to absorb steam; wring water from the cloth. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Fresh Means of obtaining and/or making potable: Dig behind the first group of sand dunes. This will allow the collection of freshwater.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
          <li>In valleys and low areas.</li>
          <li>At foot of concave banks of dry rivers.</li>
          <li>At foot of cliffs or rock outcrops.</li>
          <li>At first depression behind first sand dune of dry lakes.</li>
          <li>Wherever you find damp sand surface sand.</li>
          <li>Wherever you find green vegetation - Dig holes deep enough to allow water to seep in. In a sand dune belt, any available water will be found beneath the original valley floow at the edge of dunes.</li>
      </ul>

If you do not have a reliable source to replenish your water supply, stay alert for ways in which your environment can help you.

> **CAUTION**
> 
> DO NOT substitute the following harmful fluids for water.

| Fluid | Remarks  |
| ----- | -------- |
Alcoholic beverages | Dehydrate the body and cloud judgement.
Urine | Contains harmful body wastes. Is about 2 percent salt.
Blood | Is salty and considered a food; therefore, requires additional body fluids to digest. May transmit disease.
Seawater | Is about 4 percent salt. It takes about 2 liters of body fluids to rid the body of waster from 1 liter of seawater. Therefore, by drinking seawater, you deplete your body's water supply, which can cause death.

Heavy dew can provide water. Tie rags or tufts of fine grass around your ankles and walk through dew-covered grass before sunrise. As the rags or grass tufts absorb the dew, wring the water into a container. Repeat the process until you have a supply of water or until the dew is gone. Australian natives sometimes mop up as much as 1 liter an hour this way.

Bees or ants going into a hole in a tree may point to a water-filled hole. Siphon the water with plastic tubing or scoop it up with an improvised dipper. You can also stuff cloth in the hole to absorb the water and then wring it from the cloth.

Water sometimes gathers in tree crotches or rock crevices. Use the above procedures to get the water. In arid areas, bird droppings around a crack in the rocks may indicate water in or near the crack.

      <summary>Water From Green Bamboo</summary>
      Green bamboo thickets are an excellent source of fresh water. Water from green bamboo is clear and odorless. To get the water, bend a green bamboo stalk, tie it down, and cut off the top. The water will drip freely during the night. Old, cracked bamboo may also contain water.

      <summary>Water From Plantain or Banana Tree Stump</summary>
      <b>CAUTION</b>
      <p><b>Purify the water before drinking it.</b></p>
      Wherever you find banana trees, plantain trees, or sugarcane, you can get water. Cut down the tree, leaving about a 30-centimeter (12-inch) stump, and scoop out the center of the stump so that the hollow is bowl-shaped. Water from the roots will immediately start to fill the hollow. The first three fillings of water will be bitter, but succeeding fillings will be palatable. The stump will supply water for up to 4 days. Be sure to cover it to keep out insects.

      <summary>Water From a Vine</summary>
      <b>CAUTION</b>
      <p><b>Ensure that the vine is not poisonous.</b></p>
      Some tropical vines can give you water. Cut a notch in the vine as high as you can reach, then cut the vine off close to the ground. Catch the dropping liquid in a container or in your mouth.
