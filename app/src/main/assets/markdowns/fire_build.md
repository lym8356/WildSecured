## How To Build A Fire

There are several methods for laying a fire and each one has advantages.
The situation you are in will determine which of the following fires to use.

**TEPEE**

To make a tepee fire, arrange the tinder and a few sticks of kindling in the shape of a tepee or cone. Light the center. As the tepee burns, the outside logs will fall inward, feeding the fire. This type of fire burns well even with wet wood.

**LEAN-TO**

To lay a lean-to fire, push a green stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle.
Point the end of the stick in the direction of the wind. Place some tinder deep under this lean-to stick.
Lean pieces of kindling against the lean-to stick.
Light the tinder. As the kindling catches fire from the tinder, add more kindling.

**CROSS-DITCH**

To use the cross-ditch method, scratch a cross about 30 centimeters (12 inches) in size in the ground. Dig the cross 7.5 centimeters (about 3 inches) deep. Put a large wad of tinder in the middle of the cross. Build a kindling pyramid above the tinder. The shallow ditch allows air to sweep under the tinder to provide a draft.

**PYRAMID**

To lay the pyramid fire, place two small logs or branches parallel on the ground. Place a solid layer of small logs across the parallel logs. Add three or four more layers of logs, each layer smaller than and at a right angle to the layer below it. Make a starter fire on top of the pyramid. As the starter fire burns, it will ignite the logs below it. This gives you a fire that burns downward, requiring no attention during the night.

There are several other ways to lay a fire that are quite effective. Your situation and the material available in the area may make another method more suitable.
